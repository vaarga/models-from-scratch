# Models from Scratch

> **Note**: This repository is a collection of AI/ML models and algorithm implementations built from scratch. The 
> primary packages used for implementation are NumPy and Matplotlib for visualizations. Additionally, most 
> implementations include comparisons with those from other Python packages.

Currently, the following models and algorithms are implemented:

```
